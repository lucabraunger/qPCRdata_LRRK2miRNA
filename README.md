# qPCRdata_LRRK2miRNA
qPCR Data from our project about miRNAs as biomarkers in LRRK2 mutated Parkinson´s disease patients.

These files contain the qPCR data we measured for our project about miRNAs as biomarkers in LRRK2 mutated Parkinson´s disease (PD) patients (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.06.565815). 
We measured expression of 91 miRNAs in CSF and plasma of 32 individuals. The individuals were divided into 3 groups: fPD (familial PD patients, includes mutated PD patients and asymptomatic mutation carriers, these are labeled separately), sPD (sporadic PD patients) and HC (Healthy Controls). Ct values were determined with LinRegPCR. For interplate calibration UniSpike3 was used.
